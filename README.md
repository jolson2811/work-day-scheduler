# Work Day Scheduler

### The goal for this challenge was modify existing code with HTML, CSS, and jQuery to create a simple calendar application that is run in browser and allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule  
WHEN I open the planner  
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar  
WHEN I scroll down  
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours  
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day  
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future  
WHEN I click into a time block  
THEN I can enter an event  
WHEN I click the save button for that time block  
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage  
WHEN I refresh the page  
THEN the saved events persist
